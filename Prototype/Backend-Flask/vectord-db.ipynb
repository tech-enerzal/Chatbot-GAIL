    "      \"description\": \"The recruitment process at IIMA starts with the Manpower Requisition Form (MRF). This form is filled by the concerned department, detailing the pay level, tenure of employment, job description, and justification for the position. The approval process requires the MRF to be signed off by the department chairperson and then forwarded to the HR department. The HR Manager and the Associate Vice President-HR discuss the proposal with the department head and the Director, who give the final approval. Once approved, the job advertisement is prepared and released in selected newspapers. The advertisement copy may also be reviewed by the Head of Department for feedback before publication. The HR department segregates resumes based on eligibility and sends them to the concerned department for shortlisting. After shortlisting, the interview panel is constituted. For Manager and above positions, the interview panel includes the OEDC member, Dean, Chief Administrative Officer, Head of Department, Associate Vice President-HR, and any expert nominated by the Director. For positions below Manager level, the panel consists of the SEDC member, Head of Department, Associate VP-HR, and a nominated person. The interview process may include personal interviews, skill tests, group discussions, debates, or quizzes. Candidates are informed via email, followed by a formal letter for interview scheduling. After the interview, feedback from panel members is documented, and the HR department assists with salary negotiations and collects feedback from references if necessary. Travel reimbursement for Manager and above positions covers economy class airfare. For candidates applying to positions from Level 6 to Level 9, AC 3-tier train fare is reimbursed, while those below Level 6 are reimbursed sleeper class train fare. After selection, candidates must undergo a medical check-up or submit a fitness certificate. The joining procedure involves collecting primary details through a Candidate’s Statement and Declaration form and verifying documents such as mark sheets, certificates, birth certificate, address proof, relieving letter, latest salary slip, medical certificate, and identity proof. The final steps include the issuance of a joining report and an identity card.\"\n",
